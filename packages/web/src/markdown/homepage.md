## ðŸ•¹ The idea ðŸ•¹

A lot of people find it very difficult to decide what NPM Package, React Component, Module or Library to use.

_`They end up checking on GitHub`_ to see how active the community is. GitHub does not tell you a clear picture. It is just a part of the picture.

_`What people often miss`_, is the first hand experience of the users who have used the library.

`pkgreview.dev` displays all sort of important metadata of a package (_reviews, ratings, last updated, stargazers, etc._) and also shows `other developers' opinion` about them.

And you can `contribute by posting your review` about the NPM Package. ðŸŽ‰

## âœ¨ Building a Community âœ¨

The app that you are currently seeing is in its MVP phase.

_`To be useful to the masses, we need more reviews.` You, as a developer, can contribute a lot in this process by just posting a review to any useful package._

This project needs the support of the _`JavaScript Community`_.

<Login buttonText="ðŸ’ƒ Login with GitHub (takes two seconds) ðŸ’ƒ" />

and write your first review!
