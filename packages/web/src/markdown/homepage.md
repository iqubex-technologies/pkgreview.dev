## ðŸ•¹ The idea ðŸ•¹

A lot of people find it very difficult to decide what NPM Package, React Component, Module or Library to use.

_`They end up checking GitHub`_ stars, number of forks, ratio of open issues to closed issues, pull requests, last updated date, etc.

_`What people often miss`_, is the first hand experience of the users who have used the library.

`pkgreview.dev` will help JavaScript Developers understand and analyze what NPM Module is the best choice for them.

## âœ¨ Building a Community âœ¨

The app that you are currently seeing is in its MVP phase.

_`To be useful to the masses, we need more reviews.` You, as a developer, can contribute a lot in this process by just posting a review to any useful package._

This project needs the support of the _`JavaScript Community`_.
